In this experiment, we devise a new experimental design to test whether the testing effect is due to RPE.

You can see the code of experiment in folder "Experiment".

The experiment consists of 5 phases:

-	Phase 1 (Pre-learning): Learning word pair associations.
-	Phase 2 (Test without feedback): In each trial, choose a correct swahili traslation from four options, judge confidence. 
-	Phase 3 (Test with feedback): 80% testing trials (four options) and 20% studying trials (one option), choose correct translation, judge confidence (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), and get feedback (1: correct; 0: incorrect). RPE = feedback - confidence
-	Phase 4: First recognition test (multiple choice format).
-	Phase 5: Second recognition test to filter out flukes from real knowledge.
