There are two behavioral experiments, a modelling study, and an fMRI study.

Experiments 1 and 2 are two behavioral experiments to check whether testing effect originates from RPE.

Experiment 3 is a modelling study to check whether we can use model to simulate the behavioral patterns from two behavioral experiments.

Experiment 4 is an fMRI study to explore the neural basis of testing effect. Now, there is only behavioral data.
